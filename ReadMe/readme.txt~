/***** INFO ******/
This site was made to facilitate people moving to foreign countries to better understand their environment. It was made using AJAX through jQuery, along with 4 external APIs.

This site has the following features:
1) Shows latest articles from the New York Times.
2) Related information about that city from Wikipedia.
3) Google Maps marking that particular area.
4) Provides a background of Google Street View of that street.

I am also planning to add the following new features:
1) Latest news from the Times of India.
2) Nearby hotels and resaturants.
3) Crime rate in that particular city.
4) Nearby Schools, colleges and PGs.

/***** Improvements *****/
The layout and feel of the page don't look very elegant, since my designing skills are not very great. But I might redesign the layout with Angular, at a later time.
