/***** INFO ******/
This site was made to facilitate people moving to foreign countries to better understand their environment. It was made using AJAX through jQuery, along with 5 external APIs.

This site has the following features:
1) Shows latest articles from the New York Times.
2) Related information about that city from Wikipedia.
3) Google Maps marking that particular area.
4) Real-time Weather data about the city.
5) Provides a background of Google Street View of that street.

I am also planning to add the following new features:
1) Nearby hotels and restaurants.
2) Crime rate in that particular city.
3) Nearby Schools, colleges and PGs.
4) Latest news about India from the Times of India.
 
I might redesign the layout with Angular, at a later time.
